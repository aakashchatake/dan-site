**Objective:** Tell a data story using multiple chart types in Excel.

**Dataset:** `country_population.csv` â€“ The dataset lists the population of several countries over different years.

**Steps:**
1. Select a subset of countries and years to focus on in your story.
2. Create at least three different charts (e.g., line chart for trend, bar chart for country comparison, pie chart for share of population).
3. Arrange the charts in a logical order with captions explaining what each chart shows.
4. Ensure that the narrative flows from one chart to the next and concludes with a key insight.
5. Save the final story as a single Excel or PowerPoint file.

**Expected Output:** A series of charts placed in a logical order to convey a narrative with captions and conclusions.

**Metadata:** Tools: Excel; Duration: 2 weeks; Skills: Data Storytelling and Visualization (CO4).
