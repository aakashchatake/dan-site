# Microproject 16: Interactive Data Exploration (Automobile Dataset)

**Objective:** Explore an automobile dataset using pivot tables and slicers to find insights.

**Dataset:** `car_specs.csv` â€“ The dataset lists car specifications including Make, Fuel Type, Horsepower, Mileage, and Number of Cylinders.

**Steps:**
1. Import the car specifications dataset into Excel.
2. Create a pivot table to analyze average mileage by Fuel Type.
3. Add a slicer on Number of Cylinders to filter the pivot table.
4. Explore the data by toggling slicer buttons and record at least three insights (e.g., which fuel type offers best mileage for 4-cylinder cars).
5. Prepare a short report summarizing your findings.

**Expected Output:** An interactive pivot table with a slicer and a report containing discovered insights.

**Metadata:** Tools: Excel; Duration: 2 weeks; Skills: Data Exploration & Pivot Analysis (CO3).
