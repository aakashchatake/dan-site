# Microproject 15: Data Visualization with Different Charts

**Objective:** Create equivalent charts in Excel and Python and compare them.

**Dataset:** `population_continent.csv` â€“ The dataset contains population figures for different continents.

**Steps:**
1. Create a pie chart in Excel showing the proportion of population across continents.
2. Create the same pie chart in Python using Matplotlib.
3. Compare the look and features of the two charts.
4. Customize the colors or labels in the Python chart to match the Excel chart (or vice versa).
5. Summarize your findings in a document with both charts included.

**Expected Output:** A set of equivalent charts from Excel and Python along with a comparison write-up.

**Metadata:** Tools: Excel & Python; Duration: 1 week; Skills: Visualization & Cross-Tool Comparison (CO4, CO5).
