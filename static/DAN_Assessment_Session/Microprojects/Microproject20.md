# Microproject 20: Collaborative Microproject (City Transport Data Story)

**Objective:** Work in a team to analyze city transport data and present a cohesive story.

**Dataset:** `city_transport.csv` â€“ The dataset includes data on bus routes, average ridership, delays, and operational cost.

**Steps:**
1. Form small groups and load the city transport dataset.
2. Divide tasks among team members (data cleaning, analysis, visualization).
3. Explore the data to find patterns (e.g., routes with highest delays, cost per rider).
4. Create a variety of visuals (line charts, bar charts, maps if possible) and combine them into a presentation.
5. Deliver a final report or slide deck telling a data-driven story with recommendations for city transport improvements.

**Expected Output:** A collaborative presentation or report containing analysis, visuals, and recommendations.

**Metadata:** Tools: Excel and/or Python; Duration: 4 weeks; Skills: Teamwork & Comprehensive Analysis (CO1-CO5).
