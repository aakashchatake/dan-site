# Instructor Guide for Microprojects

This guide provides an overview of the 20 microprojects included in the **DAN_Assessment_Session** package. Each project is aligned with one or more course outcomes (COs) and integrates practical skills from the syllabus. Instructors should use this guide to monitor progress, evaluate student work, and provide feedback.

## Evaluation Rubric

The recommended evaluation for microprojects combines **process** and **product** assessment:

- **Process (60%)**: Proper problem definition, planning, and execution (cleaning, analysis, coding).
- **Product (40%)**: Quality of final deliverable (correctness of results, clarity of charts, completeness of report).
