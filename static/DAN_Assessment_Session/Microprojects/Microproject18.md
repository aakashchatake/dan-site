# Microproject 18: Matplotlib Customization Challenge

**Objective:** Apply multiple customizations to a Matplotlib plot.

**Dataset:** `trig_data.csv` â€“ The dataset contains values for angle (in degrees) and corresponding sine values.

**Steps:**
1. Read the dataset into a Python script.
2. Plot the sine wave using Matplotlib.
3. Customize the plot: change the line style and color, add gridlines, label special points (e.g., peaks) with annotations, and set custom ticks.
4. Save the plot to a high-resolution image file.
5. Include a brief commentary on how each customization improves the plot.

**Expected Output:** A customized sine wave plot saved as an image with an accompanying explanation of the customizations.

**Metadata:** Tools: Python (Matplotlib); Duration: 1 week; Skills: Plot Customization (CO5).
