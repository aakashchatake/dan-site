4. Document any benefits or challenges encountered in both tools.
5. Summarize your comparison in a short report.

**Expected Output:** Analysis files from both Excel and Python plus a comparison report.

**Metadata:** Tools: Excel and Python; Duration: 2 weeks; Skills: Tool Comparison & Analysis (CO3, CO5).
