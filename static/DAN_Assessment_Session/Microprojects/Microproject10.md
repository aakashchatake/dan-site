# Microproject 10: Matplotlib Advanced Plot

**Objective:** Practice advanced plotting in Matplotlib by combining two datasets on the same figure.

**Dataset:** `sales_profit.csv` â€“ The dataset contains monthly sales and profit figures for one year.

**Steps:**
1. Load the sales and profit data using pandas.
2. Create a subplot with two axes: one for a line chart of sales and another for a bar chart of profit.
3. Ensure both charts share the same x-axis for month labels.
4. Add legends and labels to distinguish the series.
5. Save the combined plot as a single image file.

**Expected Output:** A combined figure with a line chart and a bar chart in subplots or dual-axis showing sales and profits.

**Metadata:** Tools: Python (Matplotlib); Duration: 2 weeks; Skills: Advanced Plotting (CO5).
