# Microproject 11: Data Analysis Report (Mini-Project)

**Objective:** Conduct a comprehensive data analysis project using a real-world dataset.

**Dataset:** `weather_data.csv` – The dataset includes daily temperature, humidity, and rainfall for a city over several months.

**Steps:**
1. State two or three research questions you will investigate (e.g., “Does rainfall affect temperature?”).
2. Clean and preprocess the data as needed.
3. Compute descriptive statistics and create relevant visualizations (e.g., line plot of temperature trends, scatter plot of rainfall vs humidity).
4. Summarize your findings in a report with charts and tables.
5. Reflect on limitations and suggest improvements for further study.

**Expected Output:** A written report (2–3 pages) with charts and tables answering your research questions.

**Metadata:** Tools: Excel or Python; Duration: 3–4 weeks; Skills: Comprehensive Data Analysis (CO1-CO5).
