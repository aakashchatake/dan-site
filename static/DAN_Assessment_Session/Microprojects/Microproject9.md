# Microproject 9: Python Matplotlib Exploration

**Objective:** Develop proficiency in Matplotlib by creating multiple chart types from a small dataset.

**Dataset:** `python_sample.csv` â€“ The dataset contains a simple sequence of numbers and categories for demonstration purposes.

**Steps:**
1. Read the dataset using Python (pandas).
2. Create a line plot for the numeric sequence.
3. Generate a bar chart to visualize category frequencies.
4. Create a histogram of the numeric data.
5. Customize each plot with titles, axis labels, and save them as separate image files.

**Expected Output:** A Python script that reads the data and outputs at least three different plots saved as image files.

**Metadata:** Tools: Python (Matplotlib); Duration: 2 weeks; Skills: Coding and Visualization (CO5).
