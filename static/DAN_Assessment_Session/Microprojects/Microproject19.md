# Microproject 19: Domain Analytics Microproject (Healthcare)

**Objective:** Analyze patient data to discover insights relevant to healthcare management.

**Dataset:** `patient_data.csv` â€“ The dataset includes patient age, blood pressure, cholesterol level, and outcome (e.g., recovery, ongoing treatment).

**Steps:**
1. Load the patient dataset and review its structure.
2. Pose a research question, such as whether age or cholesterol level is associated with recovery outcome.
3. Conduct statistical analysis (e.g., correlation, descriptive statistics).
4. Create appropriate charts (scatter plot or box plot) to visualize relationships.
5. Write a short report summarizing your findings and implications for healthcare management.

**Expected Output:** A report with statistical analysis results and visuals that answer the research question.

**Metadata:** Tools: Excel or Python; Duration: 2 weeks; Skills: Domain-Specific Analysis & Visualization (CO1-CO5).
