# 3.1 Excel Dashboard: Tables, Filters, Forecasting

## Dashboards\n- A dashboard presents key metrics and trends in a single, interactive view. In Excel, dashboards combine tables, charts and controls to help users monitor performance.\n\n## Tables\n- Convert data ranges to tables (Ctrl+T) to enable structured references, automatic expansion and built-in sorting/filtering.\n- Tables improve data organisation and feed charts and pivot tables dynamically.\n\n## Filters\n- Filters narrow down data to focus on specific categories or ranges using drop-down menus.\n- Slicers and timeline controls provide visual filtering options for pivot tables and dashboards.\n\n## Forecasting\n- Excel offers functions like FORECAST.LINEAR and tools like the Forecast Sheet to project future values based on historical trends.\n- Forecasts assume patterns persist; adjust parameters for seasonality and confidence intervals.\n\n## Examples\n- Sales dashboard with a table of monthly sales by region; slicers allow users to select a region and see filtered metrics.\n- Forecasting inventory needs for the next quarter using past sales data.\n\n## Summary\nExcel dashboards combine tables, filters and forecasting tools to provide concise, actionable views of data. Effective dashboards help stakeholders track progress and make informed decisions.\n
