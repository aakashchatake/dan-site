# 3.3 Pivot Table Operations: Filtering, Sorting, Calculations

## Filtering\n- Use drop-down lists in row or column headers to select items to include or exclude.\n- Add a field to the Filters area for a global filter affecting the entire pivot table.\n- Slicers provide buttons for intuitive filtering of pivot tables.\n\n## Sorting\n- Sort row or column labels alphabetically or numerically via right-click → Sort.\n- Sort values (e.g., highest to lowest sales) to rank categories.\n\n## Calculations\n- Change summary functions from Sum to Count, Average, Max, etc. using Value Field Settings.\n- Show values as percentages of totals, differences from another item, running totals or rankings.\n- Create calculated fields to compute custom metrics from existing fields (e.g., profit = revenue – cost).\n\n## Examples\n- Filter a pivot table to analyse sales of only premium products.\n- Sort sales by descending order to highlight top-performing regions.\n- Show profit margins by adding a calculated field.\n\n## Summary\nFiltering and sorting pivot tables focus analysis on relevant data, while custom calculations provide deeper insights beyond simple sums or counts.\n
