# 5.4 Exporting and Saving Visualizations

## Saving Static Plots\n- Use  to save the current figure as a PNG; change extension to save as PDF, SVG or JPG.\n- Specify resolution with  argument (e.g., ) for high-quality prints.\n\n## Adjusting Layout\n- Call  before saving to automatically adjust spacing between subplots and labels.\n- When using subplots, save the entire figure rather than individual axes.\n\n## Interactive Visualisations\n- Matplotlib supports interactive backends for zooming and panning; Jupyter notebooks and some IDEs enable interactive widgets.\n- For more advanced interactivity, consider libraries built on Matplotlib, such as mplcursors or ipywidgets.\n\n## Examples\n- Exporting a histogram as a PDF for inclusion in a report.\n- Saving multiple plot formats (PNG and SVG) to serve web and print media.\n\n## Summary\nExporting plots in various formats ensures that visualisations can be shared and embedded across platforms. Adjusting layout and resolution prior to saving leads to professional-quality images.\n
