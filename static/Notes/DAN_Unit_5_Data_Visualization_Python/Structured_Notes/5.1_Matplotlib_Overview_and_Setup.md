# 5.1 Matplotlib Overview and Setup

## Overview\n- **Matplotlib** is a versatile Python library for creating static, animated and interactive visualisations.\n- It supports a wide range of plots: line, scatter, bar, histogram, pie, 3D plots and more.\n- Designed to resemble MATLABâ€™s plotting, it integrates seamlessly with NumPy and pandas.\n\n## Installation\n- Install via pip: Looking in indexes: https://reader:****@packages.applied-caas-gateway1.internal.api.openai.org/artifactory/api/pypi/pypi-public/simple

By default, 'file' is written in the MIFF image format.  To
specify a particular image format, precede the filename with an image
format name and a colon (i.e. ps:image) or specify the image type as
the filename suffix (i.e. image.ps).  Specify 'file' as '-' for
standard input or output..\n- Prepare data using lists, NumPy arrays or pandas DataFrame columns.\n- Customise default styles using  or choose built-in styles like .\n\n## Summary\nMatplotlib is the foundation of Python data visualisation. Installation is straightforward, and its flexible API supports a variety of plots and customisations.\n
