# 4.1 Creating Simple Charts, Charting Non-Adjacent Cells

## Creating Simple Charts\n- Select a contiguous range of data and choose Insert â†’ Recommended Charts or a specific chart type (e.g., Column, Line).\n- Excel inserts a chart object that can be resized and positioned.\n\n## Charting Non-Adjacent Cells\n- Hold Ctrl and select separate ranges or cells to include non-adjacent data in the same chart.\n- Alternatively, create a new range containing the desired data using formulas and chart that range.\n\n## Best Practices\n- Choose chart types appropriate for the data: column charts for comparisons, line charts for trends, scatter plots for relationships.\n- Use chart titles and axis labels to explain what is plotted.\n\n## Examples\n- Plotting quarterly revenue from separate columns for each region on a single line chart.\n- Creating a bar chart of product sales from non-adjacent cells using Ctrl-selection.\n\n## Summary\nExcel facilitates quick visualisation of data. Selecting the correct ranges and chart type ensures clarity and effectiveness of the representation.\n
