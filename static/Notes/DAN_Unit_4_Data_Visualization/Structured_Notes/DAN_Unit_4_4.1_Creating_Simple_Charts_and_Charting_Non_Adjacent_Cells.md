# 4.1 Creating Simple Charts & Charting Non‑Adjacent Cells

## Creating simple charts

To create a chart in Excel:

1. Select the data range including labels.
2. Go to **Insert > Recommended Charts** and choose a suitable chart type, such as column, bar or line【960823345337559†L688-L707】.
3. Insert the chart; Excel places it on the worksheet.

## Charting non‑adjacent cells

Sometimes the data you want to plot are in separate ranges. To chart non‑adjacent cells:

1. Select the first range.
2. Hold **Ctrl** and select the additional range or ranges.
3. Insert the desired chart type. Excel will combine the ranges into a single chart.

## Example

To compare sales (column B) with profits (column D) for five products, select column B, hold **Ctrl**, select column D and insert a column chart. Both series appear side‑by‑side.
