# 4.2 Chart Wizard, Modifying & Moving Charts

## Chart wizard

Older versions of Excel offered a **Chart Wizard** that guided users through choosing a chart type, selecting data and formatting. Modern Excel replaces the wizard with the **Recommended Charts** feature, which suggests appropriate chart types based on selected data【960823345337559†L760-L840】.

## Modifying charts

Once a chart is created, you can customise it:

* **Chart title and axis titles** – Select the chart and use the **Chart Elements** button (+) to add or edit titles.
* **Data series** – Right‑click and choose **Select Data** to add or remove series.
* **Swap axes** – Use the **Switch Row/Column** button to change how series are plotted.
* **Colours and styles** – Use the **Chart Styles** gallery to change colours or layouts【960823345337559†L760-L840】.

## Moving charts

To move a chart to a new location:

1. Select the chart.
2. Choose **Chart Design > Move Chart**.
3. Select **New sheet** to create a chart sheet or **Object in** to place it on another worksheet.

## Example

After creating a bar chart of quarterly sales, add axis titles, change the chart colours to a monochrome palette and move the chart to its own sheet for a cleaner presentation.

## Summary

Although the chart wizard is no longer present, Excel provides intuitive tools to modify charts, change chart types and move charts within the workbook【960823345337559†L760-L840】.
