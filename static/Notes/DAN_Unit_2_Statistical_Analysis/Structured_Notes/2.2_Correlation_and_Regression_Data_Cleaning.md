# 2.2 Correlation and Regression, Data Cleaning

## Correlation\n- Measures the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two variables.\n- The **correlation coefficient (r)** ranges from -1 to +1; values near Â±1 indicate strong linear relationships.\n- Correlation does not imply causation.\n\n## Regression\n- Models the relationship between dependent and independent variables to predict outcomes.\n- In **simple linear regression**, the equation is \( y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x + \epsilon \).\n- Regression distinguishes between predictor and response variables and can include multiple predictors.\n\n## Data Cleaning\n- **Remove duplicates** and obvious errors.\n- **Handle missing values**: options include deleting rows (if few) or imputing with mean/median/mode.\n- **Standardise formats**: ensure consistent units and date formats; detect outliers for further investigation.\n\n## Examples\n- A high positive correlation between study time and exam scores suggests that more studying is associated with higher scores.\n- Regression can predict house prices based on size, location and features.\n- Imputing missing ages in a survey using the median age preserves sample size.\n\n## Summary\nCorrelation quantifies associations, while regression builds predictive models. Clean data are essential: missing or inconsistent values can distort correlations and regression coefficients.\n
