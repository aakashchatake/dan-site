# 2.5 Scatter Diagram

## Purpose\nA scatter diagram (scatter plot) visualises the relationship between two quantitative variables by plotting paired observations on a Cartesian plane.\n\n## Construction\n- Place the independent variable on the x-axis and the dependent variable on the y-axis.\n- Plot each pair (x, y) as a point.\n- Look for patterns, trends or clusters.\n\n## Interpretation\n- **Positive correlation**: points cluster around a line with positive slope.\n- **Negative correlation**: points cluster around a line with negative slope.\n- **No correlation**: points are scattered randomly with no discernible pattern.\n- **Outliers**: points far from the main cluster may indicate anomalies.\n- Non-linear relationships appear as curved patterns; additional transformations or models may be needed.\n\n## Examples\n- Height vs weight of individuals often shows a positive relationship.\n- Advertising spend vs sales revenue can be visualised to assess marketing effectiveness.\n\n## Summary\nScatter diagrams provide a quick visual check of the direction and strength of relationships between variables, helping choose appropriate modelling techniques.\n
