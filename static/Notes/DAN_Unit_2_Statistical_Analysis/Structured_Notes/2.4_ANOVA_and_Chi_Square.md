# 2.4 ANOVA and Chi Square

## ANOVA (Analysis of Variance)\n- Tests whether the means of three or more groups differ significantly.\n- **One-way ANOVA** has one categorical independent variable with multiple levels; compares between-group and within-group variability.\n- **F-statistic**: ratio of variance between groups to variance within groups. A high F-value suggests group means differ more than expected by random variation.\n- If significant, follow-up tests (e.g., Tukey’s HSD) identify which groups differ.\n\n## Chi Square Tests\n- **Goodness-of-fit test**: compares observed frequencies with expected frequencies under a hypothesised distribution. Statistic: \( \chi^2 = \sum \frac{(O_i - E_i)^2}{E_i} \).\n- **Test of independence**: evaluates whether two categorical variables are independent using a contingency table; degrees of freedom equal (rows - 1) × (columns - 1).\n- A large chi-square statistic relative to critical value suggests the observed frequencies deviate significantly from expectation.\n\n## Examples\n- ANOVA can compare average weights of different plant fertiliser groups.\n- Chi-square goodness-of-fit can test whether dice are fair.\n- Chi-square test of independence can assess whether gender and voting preference are independent.\n\n## Summary\nANOVA examines differences in means across multiple groups, while chi-square tests evaluate frequency distributions. Both rely on comparing calculated statistics to critical values to determine significance.\n
