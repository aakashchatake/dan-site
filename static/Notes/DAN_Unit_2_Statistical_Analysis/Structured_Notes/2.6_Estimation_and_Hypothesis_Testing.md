# 2.6 Estimation and Hypothesis Testing

## Estimation\n- **Point estimation**: uses a single statistic (e.g., sample mean) as the best guess of a population parameter.\n- **Interval estimation (confidence interval)**: provides a range of values that likely contain the parameter with a specified confidence level (e.g., 95%).\n\n## Hypothesis Testing\n- **Null hypothesis (H₀)**: statement of no effect or status quo.\n- **Alternative hypothesis (H₁)**: statement of an effect or difference.\n- Steps:\n  1. State H₀ and H₁.\n  2. Choose significance level (α, such as 0.05).\n  3. Select appropriate test (z-test, t-test, chi-square, etc.).\n  4. Compute test statistic and corresponding p-value.\n  5. Compare p-value with α: if p < α, reject H₀; otherwise, fail to reject H₀.\n- Types of errors: **Type I error** (false positive) occurs when H₀ is wrongly rejected; **Type II error** (false negative) occurs when H₀ is not rejected when it is false.\n\n## Examples\n- Testing whether a new drug lowers blood pressure more than a placebo.\n- Estimating the proportion of defective items in a production batch with a 95% confidence interval.\n\n## Summary\nEstimation provides point and interval estimates for population parameters, while hypothesis testing assesses claims using sample data. Clear formulation of hypotheses and careful choice of tests are essential for valid conclusions.\n
