# 2.1 Boxplot, Skewness, Kurtosis, Descriptive Stats

## Graphical Techniques\n- **Histograms** show the distribution of numerical data by grouping values into bins.\n- **Boxplots** display the median, quartiles and outliers, providing a visual summary of centre and spread.\n\n## Shape Measures\n- **Skewness**: measures asymmetry; positive skew indicates a long right tail; negative skew indicates a long left tail.\n- **Kurtosis**: measures tail heaviness; high kurtosis (leptokurtic) indicates heavy tails; low kurtosis (platykurtic) indicates light tails.\n\n## Descriptive Statistics\n- Use numerical summaries (mean, median, mode) and variability measures (range, variance, standard deviation).\n- Identify outliers using methods like interquartile range or z-scores and decide on treatment.\n\n## Examples\n- A boxplot of exam scores can show skewness and highlight top performers or underperformers.\n- Financial return distributions often exhibit positive kurtosis due to occasional extreme gains or losses.\n\n## Summary\nVisual and numerical summaries reveal the central tendency, spread and shape of data distributions. Recognising skewness and kurtosis helps select appropriate statistical models.\n
