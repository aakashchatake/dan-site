# 2.3 Imputation Techniques

## Why Impute?\n- Datasets often contain missing values due to nonresponse, recording errors or sensor failures.\n- Deleting incomplete records can bias results or reduce statistical power.\n\n## Simple (Univariate) Imputation\n- **Mean imputation**: replace missing values with the average of observed values; suited for symmetric distributions.\n- **Median imputation**: uses the middle value; robust to outliers.\n- **Mode imputation**: fills missing categorical data with the most frequent category.\n- **Constant imputation**: assigns a fixed value (e.g., zero) when missingness indicates absence.\n\n## Multivariate Imputation\n- Utilises relationships among variables to estimate missing values.\n- Techniques include **regression imputation**, where missing values are predicted using regression models, and **iterative imputation**, which repeatedly fits models to predict missing entries.\n\n## Multiple Imputation\n- Generates several complete datasets with different imputed values and combines results, reflecting uncertainty in the missing data.\n\n## Examples\n- Filling missing income values using regression based on age, education and occupation.\n- For a survey with skipped questions, using the mode for categorical responses preserves category distribution.\n\n## Summary\nImputation retains valuable data by replacing missing entries with estimated values. Simple methods are easy but may underestimate variability; multivariate and multiple imputation incorporate relationships and uncertainty for more robust results.\n
