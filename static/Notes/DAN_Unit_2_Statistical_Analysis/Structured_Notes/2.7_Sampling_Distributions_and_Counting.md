# 2.7 Sampling Distributions and Counting

## Sampling Distributions\n- The distribution of a statistic (e.g., mean, proportion) across many random samples of the same size from a population.\n- The sampling distribution of the mean becomes approximately normal (by the CLT) as sample size increases.\n- **Standard error**: standard deviation of a sampling distribution; for the mean, it is \(\sigma/\sqrt{n}\). Larger samples yield smaller standard errors.\n\n## Counting Principles\n- **Multiplication rule**: if one event can occur in m ways and another independent event can occur in n ways, there are m×n total ways.\n- **Permutations (P(n, r))**: number of ways to arrange r items selected from n distinct items where order matters: \( \frac{n!}{(n-r)!} \).\n- **Combinations (C(n, r))**: number of ways to choose r items from n without regard to order: \( \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!} \).\n\n## Examples\n- The number of possible outcomes when rolling two dice is 6 × 6 = 36.\n- Number of ways to arrange the letters ABC is 3! = 6.\n- Number of 5-card poker hands from a 52-card deck: C(52, 5) = 2,598,960.\n\n## Summary\nSampling distributions allow us to understand variability of statistics across samples, and counting principles are fundamental for determining probabilities in complex experiments.\n
