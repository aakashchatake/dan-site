# 2.8 Probability and Probability Distributions

## Probability Basics\n- Probability quantifies the likelihood of events, ranging from 0 (impossible) to 1 (certain).\n- **Complement rule**: P(A') = 1 - P(A).\n- **Addition rule**: For mutually exclusive events A and B, P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B).\n- **Multiplication rule**: For independent events A and B, P(A and B) = P(A) × P(B).\n\n## Discrete Distributions\n- **Binomial distribution**: models the number of successes in n independent Bernoulli trials with success probability p.\n- **Poisson distribution**: models the number of events occurring in a fixed interval when events happen at a constant average rate λ.\n\n## Continuous Distributions\n- **Normal distribution**: symmetric bell-shaped curve characterised by mean μ and standard deviation σ. Approximately 68% of observations fall within ±1σ, 95% within ±2σ.\n- **Uniform distribution**: all outcomes in an interval are equally likely.\n- **Exponential distribution**: models time between events in a Poisson process.\n\n## Examples\n- Binomial: probability of 3 heads in 5 coin tosses.\n- Poisson: number of emails received per hour.\n- Normal: height distribution of adults.\n\n## Summary\nProbability rules provide the foundation for computing likelihoods of events. Discrete and continuous distributions model different types of data and underpin statistical inference.\n
