# 1.3 Lifecycle, Quality & Quantity of Data

## Data Analytics Lifecycle\n- **Problem definition**: clarify objectives and questions to be answered.\n- **Data collection**: gather data from databases, surveys, sensors or web scraping.\n- **Data cleaning**: handle missing values, remove duplicates, correct inconsistencies.\n- **Analysis**: perform exploratory analysis and build models to uncover patterns.\n- **Interpretation and deployment**: communicate findings to stakeholders and integrate into decision-making.\n\n## Data Quality\n- **Accuracy**: data should reflect reality without errors.\n- **Completeness**: all necessary values should be present; missing values need addressing.\n- **Consistency**: formats and units should be uniform across datasets.\n\n## Quantity of Data\n- Larger datasets usually yield more reliable models, but only if the data are relevant and high-quality. Too little data leads to high variance; too much irrelevant data increases noise and cost.\n\n## Examples\n- A survey with incomplete responses requires cleaning before analysis.\n- Combining datasets requires ensuring units (e.g., currencies) are consistent.\n\n## Summary\nFollowing the analytics lifecycle and maintaining high data quality ensures that insights are trustworthy. Balancing the quantity of data collected prevents overloading systems while providing sufficient information for analysis.\n
