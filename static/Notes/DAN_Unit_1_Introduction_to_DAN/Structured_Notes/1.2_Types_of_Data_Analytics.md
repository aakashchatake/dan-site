# 1.2 Types of Data Analytics

## Overview\nDifferent problems require different analytic approaches. Understanding the categories helps select the right method.\n\n## Types\n- **Descriptive analytics**: summarises past events using totals, averages and counts.\n- **Diagnostic analytics**: explores why something happened, identifying causes through deeper analysis and comparisons.\n- **Predictive analytics**: uses historical data to forecast future outcomes via regression, time-series models and machine learning.\n- **Prescriptive analytics**: recommends actions by evaluating possible options and optimising against objectives.\n\n## Examples\n- Descriptive: reporting quarterly sales to reveal trends.\n- Diagnostic: investigating a sudden drop in website traffic to find underlying factors.\n- Predictive: forecasting energy demand based on weather patterns.\n- Prescriptive: determining the best delivery route to minimise time and fuel.\n\n## Summary\nThese four types build on one another: descriptive and diagnostic methods lay the groundwork, while predictive and prescriptive analytics help anticipate and shape the future.\n
