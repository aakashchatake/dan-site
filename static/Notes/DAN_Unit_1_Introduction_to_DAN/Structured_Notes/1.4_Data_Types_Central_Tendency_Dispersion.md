# 1.4 Data Types, Central Tendency, Dispersion

## Data Types\n- **Qualitative (categorical)**: labels without inherent order (e.g., gender, colours).\n- **Quantitative (numerical)**: can be measured and ordered. Includes **interval** (differences are meaningful, no true zero, e.g., temperature Â°C) and **ratio** (meaningful zero, e.g., weight).\n\n## Measures of Central Tendency\n- **Mean**: arithmetic average, sensitive to outliers.\n- **Median**: middle value when data are ordered; robust to outliers.\n- **Mode**: most frequently occurring value(s).\n\n## Measures of Dispersion\n- **Range**: difference between maximum and minimum values.\n- **Variance**: average squared deviation from the mean; reflects variability.\n- **Standard deviation**: square root of variance; expresses dispersion in original units.\n\n## Examples\n- In the set [2, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 7], the mean is 4.4, median is 4, mode is 4.\n- For exam scores, a high standard deviation indicates widely spread scores.\n\n## Summary\nUnderstanding data types guides which summary statistics to use. Measures of central tendency describe where data centre, while measures of dispersion describe how spread out the data are.\n
