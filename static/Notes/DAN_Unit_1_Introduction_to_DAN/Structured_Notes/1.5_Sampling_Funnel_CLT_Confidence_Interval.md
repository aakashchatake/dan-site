# 1.5 Sampling Funnel, CLT, Confidence Interval

## Sampling Funnel\n- **Population**: entire set of items or individuals of interest.\n- **Sampling frame**: list or method used to select sample elements.\n- **Sample**: subset of the population used to infer characteristics.\n- **Random sampling**: every member has equal probability of selection; reduces bias.\n\n## Central Limit Theorem (CLT)\n- When the sample size is sufficiently large (n ≥ 30), the sampling distribution of the sample mean approximates a normal distribution, regardless of the population’s distribution.\n- The mean of the sampling distribution equals the population mean μ, and its standard deviation (standard error) is σ/√n.\n\n## Confidence Interval\n- Provides a range of plausible values for a population parameter.\n- For a mean: \( \bar{x} \pm z_{\alpha/2} \times \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}} \), where \(z_{\alpha/2}\) is the critical value from the normal distribution and \(s\) is the sample standard deviation.\n\n## Examples\n- Drawing multiple random samples from a class and computing the average height yields sample means that cluster around the true mean.\n- A 95% confidence interval for average daily sales might be 500 ± 20, suggesting the true mean is between 480 and 520.\n\n## Summary\nRandom sampling ensures representative data. The CLT justifies using normality for inference, and confidence intervals quantify uncertainty around estimated parameters.\n
